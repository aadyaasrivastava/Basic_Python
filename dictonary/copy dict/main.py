# using copy() method:
#
# thisdict = {
#   "brand": "BMW",
#   "model": "M",
#   "year": 2021
# }
# mydict = thisdict.copy()
# print(mydict)
#Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in function dict().

# thisdict = {
#   "brand": "Ford",
#   "model": "Mustang",
#   "year": 1964
# }
# mydict = dict(thisdict)
# print(mydict)
